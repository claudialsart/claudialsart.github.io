Claudia Ls Art
Italian-born oil painter based in London. My work explores space, emotion, and the silence in between.

<section class="artist-statement"> <h2>What I Paint</h2> <p>I create what I cannot explain in words — emotions that echo like gravity, stillness that feels infinite. Through oil painting, I explore the quiet drama of space and the intimate turbulence of human feeling. My style moves between realism and abstraction, between cosmos and closeness. I call it abstract emotional realism — a visual language of tenderness, silence, and survival.</p> </section> <section class="my-journey"> <h2>My Journey</h2> <p>I’m a self-taught artist. I didn’t follow a traditional path, I carved one. My art is born from solitude, deep reflection, and a personal transformation sparked by motherhood. After losing nearly everything: my home, my studio, my sense of direction. I began again. Painting became a way to hold onto something real, something I could control, shape, and pour myself into. It still is.</p> </section> <section class="where-i-am"> <h2>Where I Am Now</h2> <p>Right now, I’m rebuilding: my body of work, my studio, and my visibility. I don’t have a team. I don’t post daily. I’m not part of a gallery yet. But I’m here, painting at night while my baby sleeps, showing up in quiet, persistent ways. I currently accept commissions and create one-of-a-kind oil paintings from a small home space in London. Every piece is part of this slow, powerful comeback. These aren’t just paintings. They’re fragments of survival, hope, and the cosmos inside me.</p> </section> <section class="connect"> <h2>Let’s Connect</h2> <p>I welcome serious inquiries for custom work or future collaborations.
