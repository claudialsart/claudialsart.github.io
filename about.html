        <h2>What I Paint</h2>
        <p>I create what I cannot explain in words, emotions that echo like gravity, stillness that feels infinite.
        Through oil painting, I explore the quiet drama of space and the intimate turbulence of human feeling.
        My style moves between realism and abstraction, between cosmos and closeness.
        I call it abstract emotional realism, a visual language of tenderness, silence, and survival.</p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a self-taught artist. I didn’t follow a traditional path. I carved one.
        My art is born from solitude, deep reflection, and a personal transformation sparked by motherhood.
        I lost almost everything: my home, my studio, and my sense of direction. So I began again.
        Painting became a way to hold onto something real. Something I could control, shape, and pour myself into.
        It still is.
